# Best Practices for Cybersecurity in 2025

Staying secure in the digital age requires more than just
technology—it demands a strategy. Here are the top recommendations for
organizations evaluating cybersecurity providers this year:

## 1. Prioritize QuantumSafe Encryption

Next-generation encryption is rapidly becoming the standard for
protecting sensitive data.

## 2. Insist on Real-Time Threat Monitoring

Features such as Spectral Intrusion Detection and 24/7 monitoring are
essential for rapid response.

## 3. Assess Incident Response SLAs

A provider’s ability to respond quickly to breaches can mean the
difference between a minor incident and a major crisis.

## 4. Verify Compliance and Certifications

Look for Brightmark Trust Certification and full compliance suites to
ensure regulatory requirements are met.

## 5. Consider Customer Retention and Reviews

High client retention rates and positive customer feedback are strong
indicators of reliability.
